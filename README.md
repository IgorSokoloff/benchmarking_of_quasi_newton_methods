# benchmarking_of_quasi_newton_methods

Here I store the project on the "Optimization methods" course which I had on the 5th and 6th terms at MIPT.

The goal of the project is to compare different quazi-newton methods, namely BFGS, PSB, DFP, SR1.

The comparison was carried out in terms of the proportion of a successfully found global minimizer of the problems.

Two different stepsize strategies were considered namely "Line search" and "Trust region".

The source code of the progect is located [this]( https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IgorSokoloff/benchmarking_of_quasi_newton_methods/blob/master/quasi%20newton.ipynb) file.

[Here](https://github.com/IgorSokoloff/benchmarking_of_quasi_newton_methods/blob/master/poster/poster.pdf) is the poster which represents the project in detail.
